# 9Router — Web Fetch

## Gateway execution

Read [Verified JALA model defaults and live catalog](../9router/references/models.md) before selecting a model. It takes precedence over provider and model examples below. Codex, OpenAI API, and Exa connections are configured for this plugin.

The JALA gateway is **https://9router.jala.tech**. It is already deployed; do not install a server or ask users for a gateway URL. Every request requires the user's API key.

Read [credential setup and request helper](../9router/references/authentication.md) before making requests. Use the bundled `gateway.py` helper to load the key without exposing it to chat or command arguments. If no key is configured, launch `gateway.py setup-web --no-open` and open its local URL for the user to submit their key. Do not inspect the key field or capture the page while they enter it. Never ask them to paste the key into chat. The terminal `setup` fallback must be run by the user. `NINEROUTER_KEY` is an optional environment override. Do not read or display the saved credential file.

The curl/SDK examples below document endpoint shapes. Prefer the helper for execution; it uses the fixed JALA URL and authenticates discovery and inference calls. Substitute IDs and options discovered from this deployment for example models. Do not automatically repeat generation POSTs after an ambiguous timeout. This plugin supplies local scripts and REST guidance, not MCP tools or a host model-provider configuration.


Uses the hosted JALA gateway and a per-user API key. Read [9Router setup](../9router/SKILL.md) for deployment configuration and authentication.

## Discover

```bash
curl $NINEROUTER_URL/v1/models/web | jq '.data[] | select(.kind=="webFetch") | .id'
# Per-provider params
curl "$NINEROUTER_URL/v1/models/info?id=firecrawl/fetch"
```

IDs end in `/fetch` (e.g. `firecrawl/fetch`, `jina/fetch`). `fetch-combo` chains providers with auto-fallback.

The live catalog ID is `exa/fetch`; the request endpoint expects
`model: "exa"`. Use the helper `run` command to apply this translation.

## Endpoint

`POST $NINEROUTER_URL/v1/web/fetch`

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `model` (or `provider`) | yes | from `/v1/models/web` (e.g. `firecrawl` or `jina-reader`) |
| `url` | yes | URL to extract |
| `format` | no | `markdown` (default) / `text` / `html` |
| `max_characters` | no | truncate output |

## Examples

### Jina Reader
```bash
curl -X POST $NINEROUTER_URL/v1/web/fetch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NINEROUTER_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"jina-reader","url":"https://9router.com","format":"markdown"}'
```

### Exa
```bash
curl -X POST $NINEROUTER_URL/v1/web/fetch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NINEROUTER_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"exa","url":"https://example.com","format":"markdown","max_characters":0}'
```

### Firecrawl
```bash
curl -X POST $NINEROUTER_URL/v1/web/fetch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NINEROUTER_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"firecrawl","url":"https://example.com","format":"markdown","max_characters":0}'
```

### Tavily
```bash
curl -X POST $NINEROUTER_URL/v1/web/fetch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NINEROUTER_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"tavily","url":"https://example.com","format":"markdown","max_characters":0}'
```

### Ollama Cloud

Uses the API key from the existing `ollama` connection.

```bash
curl -X POST $NINEROUTER_URL/v1/web/fetch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NINEROUTER_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"ollama","url":"https://example.com","format":"markdown"}'
```


JS:

```js
const r = await fetch(`${process.env.NINEROUTER_URL}/v1/web/fetch`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.NINEROUTER_KEY}`, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ model: "fetch-combo", url: "https://example.com", format: "markdown", max_characters: 5000 }),
});
const data = await r.json();
console.log(data.title, data.content.text.length);
```

## Response shape

```json
{
  "provider": "jina-reader",
  "url": "...",
  "title": "...",
  "content": { "format": "markdown", "text": "...", "length": 1234 },
  "links": ["https://example.com/related"],
  "metadata": { "author": null, "published_at": null, "language": null },
  "usage": { "fetch_cost_usd": 0 },
  "metrics": { "response_time_ms": 850, "upstream_latency_ms": 700 }
}
```

`links` is included when the upstream provider returns discovered page links (currently Ollama Cloud).

## Provider quirks

| Provider | Auth | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `firecrawl` | Bearer | JS-rendered pages, `format=markdown/html` |
| `jina-reader` | Bearer (optional) | Free tier (~1M chars/mo); fastest plain markdown |
| `tavily` | Bearer | Bulk extract; returns `raw_content` |
| `exa` | `x-api-key` | Pre-indexed pages; fast text extraction |
| `ollama` | Bearer | Markdown plus page title and discovered links; uses the Ollama Cloud key |
